# React Storybool Example

This is a basic React project with a couple of components.
We are going to create a storybook for this project using OpenAI models.
We will test 2 main approaches:
    - Zero-shot
    - Few-shot

We will also create a branch called `mantine`for creating a storybook using Mantine components.

Note: Our components use `PropTypes` for type checking. (It helps the model to create a better storybook)
